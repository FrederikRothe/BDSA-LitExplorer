# BDSA-LitExplore

## Welcome!
We're group h√•rd scneft and we've been working on the Literature Explore project. In short, a data base that stores academic papers and their relations with other papers based on certain criteria. Our primary focus has been on allowing users to create said connections and also share them with others. 

## Starting the program
Navigate to the ``./LitExplore/`` folder and run the ``.\Start-Application.ps1`` PowerShell script.

## Things to do
Here are a some pointers to the focus areas of our vertical slice.
- View paper information.
- View, Create, Update & Delete connections and their information.
- Check out the predefined team or create your own to experience admin functionality.
- Share your connections with different teams.
- The burger menu contains an *About* page with information about us and the project.
- Have fun!
